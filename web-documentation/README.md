# Godui

> An easy to use GUI library for Godot.

### What it is

Godui (pronounced as go-dooey) helps you to easiy create dynamic graphical user interfaces (formerly known as GUI) for your Godot projects. 

### Declarative

All the tree structure rendering is done inside code declaratively, this means you don't need to handle with any specific implementation to create, reference, update or delete a node, Godui handles all of that while leaving freedom to modify the node as you want.

### Reactivity

The library also makes it easy to update the interface to react to changes, it's flexibility allows you to update a specific portion or the entire interface on specific events.

### Animations

The Motion system allows you to easily define custom animations to interface inside code, being able to animate all kinds of properties or function calls.

### Compatibility

As Godui behaves as a wrapper to easily modify the scene tree of a interface, it's 100% compatible with all Godot's built-in types and custom classes, including Control and non-Control nodes, while focusing on more utilities for Controls, it's completely possible to add other node types to the interface.
